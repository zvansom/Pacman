# Pacman

This is a clone of the 1980 Namco game, Pacman.  The objective of Pacman is to collect all of the flashing dots on the board without being caught by the ghosts on the map.  There are four 'power pills' in the maze that gives Pacman the ability to eat the ghosts for a short time.  Once all dots are collected from the maze the stage is complete and a new stage is generated.  Gameplay continues until the player has lost all of their lives.
